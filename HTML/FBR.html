        <h2>Lewis Smith (line manager)</h2><p> “<span>Since joining BT in the summer you have grown massively!</span> You came in with no prior knowledge 
          and if someone new met you, I dont think they would believe you! The virtual lab you created is very impressive as well as the HTML 
          and CSS upskilling you have been undertaking!”<br><br>“Don't be afraid to try things out for yourself and <span>try and troubleshoot the issue.</span> 
          But dont be afraid to ask for help when needed!”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-p">
          <h2>Jon Quinnell (rotation manager)</h2><p>“You've come a long way since your first day joining BT. I am please that <span>you've shown great willingness 
            to bridge the knowledge gap </span>against other apprentices who have had a more grounded knowledge in IT.
            The relationship between the team members here in Adastral has been solid from the start, and that's mainly due to your easy going nature and hard
            working attitiude. I've personally been surprised at how much knowledge you have been able to consume in such a short amount of time, I have no doubt 
            if you continue to work hard at this you will have a successful IT career going forward, well done.”<br><span>Continue to question everything until you have 
            sufficient knowledge in the subject.</span> Give yourself a depth of knowledge where you can, particularly in areas that interest you. This will stand you in good 
            stead going forward through your rotations.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-p">
        <h2>Daniel Wegg (colleague)</h2><p>“Overall, you have been a brilliant colleague to work with, providing skills to group tasks such as html and 
          CSS expertise and <span>always having the interests of other colleagues in mind.</span> You follow the digital principles and are an ally"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-p">
        <h2>Alex Davies (rotation lead)</h2><p>“Since you've joined the team you has increased your knowledge in IT considerably compared to where 
          you were when you started. You've shown interest in all concepts of IT and even <span>continue to learn in your own time showing initiative 
          that you want to learn more.</span> This is exactly what will get you ahead in the future.”<br><br>
          “The only thing I can think of that Charlotte needs to <span>improve on is troubleshooting methodology.</span>
          But this will come with time and practice. This will really benefit you later on in your IT career. You've been a pleasure to have in the team 
          and a great student when it's come to knowledge share and teaching you initially when you started. 
          I can see you doing really well with your apprenticeship over the next few years. Keep it up!”</p>
