          “You've come a long way since your first day joining BT. I am pleased
          that
          <span
            >you've shown great willingness to bridge the knowledge gap </span
          >against other apprentices who have had a more grounded knowledge in
          IT. The relationship between the team members here in Adastral has
          been solid from the start, and that's mainly due to your easy going
          nature and hard working attitiude. I've personally been surprised at
          how much knowledge you have been able to consume in such a short
          amount of time, I have no doubt if you continue to work hard at this
          you will have a successful IT career going forward, well done.”<br /><br /><span
            >Continue to question everything until you have sufficient knowledge
            in the subject.</span
          >
          Give yourself a depth of knowledge where you can, particularly in
          areas that interest you. This will stand you in good stead going
          forward through your rotations.”

      <div class="box-p">
        <h2>Alex Davies (Rotation lead)</h2>
        <p>
          “Since you've joined the team you have increased your knowledge in IT
          considerably compared to where you were when you started. You've shown
          interest in all concepts of IT and even
          <span
            >continue to learn in your own time showing initiative that you want
            to learn more.</span
          >
          This is exactly what will get you ahead in the future.”<br /><br />
          “The only thing I can think of that Charlotte needs to
          <span>improve on is troubleshooting methodology.</span> But this will
          come with time and practice. This will really benefit you later on in
          your IT career. You've been a pleasure to have in the team and a great
          student when it's come to knowledge share and teaching you initially
          when you started. I can see you doing really well with your
          apprenticeship over the next few years. Keep it up!”

          <span>always having the interests of other colleagues in mind.</span>
          You follow the digital principles and are an ally"

          “<span>Since joining BT in the summer you have grown massively!</span>
          You came in with no prior knowledge and if someone new met you, I dont
          think they would believe you! The virtual lab you created is very
          impressive as well as the HTML and CSS upskilling you have been
          undertaking!”<br /><br />“Don't be afraid to try things out for
          yourself and <span>try and troubleshoot the issue.</span> But dont be
          afraid to ask for help when needed!”
