entuity config what I did ALEX:

made a VM on Dlite red hat linux 8 64bit. installed/configured hostname,
network and storage etc.

logged onto putty and ssh to repo, where I edited the ansible host file and created a new host group
which will manage my entuity server.

ansible is a open sourcesoftware made by red hat written in python that 
it is a automation tool, which is a form of infrastructure as code. (you specify config in yaml file and it will interpret/
run for you
playbooks are writtewn in yaml and this is where u predefine infrastructure. it is agentless so no software agent needs to be installed on end device. ansible uses ssh or powershell to
initiate tasks on managed device.

used an ansible playbook to conduct iunitial config on freshly installed RHEL VM, some of these config tasks where:
-install/config repo
-joining red hat server to AD domain
-config ssh
-config MOTD banner(stonks/bt banner when open server)
-installing prerequisites software using newly config repo

then used SCP (file copy utility using ssh) to transfer entuity installer iso file to my server
then i mounted this iso file onto a new directory and ran installer and started entuity up.
