virtual lab enviroment CERP:
- deployed pfsense as a virtual firewall/router as a gateway to my test network
- configured port forwarding to rdp to my domain controller
- tried to configure role based access control on Vsphere
- built repo server to install nginx on web server so that rather than default open web page, chnages to index.html file.


site:
- Hyper Text Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheet
- syntax like front end dev liabaries such as jQuery, bootstrap, SASS etc.
-javascript also



Lee for github:
- code review set up so he can construct feedback
- merging chnages made
- commit pushes to repos


entuity config what I did ALEX:

made a VM on Dlite red hat linux 8 64bit. installed/configured hostname,
network and storage etc.

logged onto putty and ssh to repo, where I edited the ansible host file and created a new host group
which will manage my entuity server.

ansible is a open sourcesoftware made by red hat written in python that 
it is a automation tool, which is a form of infrastructure as code. (you specify config in yaml file and it will interpret/
run for you
playbooks are written in yaml and this is where u predefine infrastructure. it is agentless so no software agent needs to be installed on end device. ansible uses ssh or powershell to
initiate tasks on managed device.

used an ansible playbook to conduct iunitial config on freshly installed RHEL VM, some of these config tasks where:
-install/config repo
-joining red hat server to AD domain
-config ssh
-config MOTD banner(stonks/bt banner when open server)
-installing prerequisites software using newly config repo

then used SCP (file copy utility using ssh) to transfer entuity installer iso file to my server
then i mounted this iso file onto a new directory and ran installer and started entuity up.


monitoring on dashbaord web GUI MARK:



sandbox:
- config proxy which acts as gateway for security purposes to reach internet
- repo is a repository we can download files ontofrom WINSCP

dan python:

leanring string, variables, operators and syntax through things like creating: 
-palindrome (spelt same forward and backward)
-mancala
-playlist top almbum hits 
-rock paper sissors game 
-turtle graphics liabary (using graphical output to see visual response to input)
